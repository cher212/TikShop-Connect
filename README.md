# TikShop-Connect

## Inspiration

The inspiration for TikShop Connect came from our members using the TikTok shopping feature and finding it difficult to share their favourite items amongst their friends. Currently, they would have to individually share the product listing via TikTok chats or sharing the link via other communication platforms.  
Imagine a TikTok user, Rachel, who is an avid fashion enthusiast. She frequently scrolls through TikTok Shop and her TikTok For You Page to discover new clothing trends and she likes finding brands endorsed by her favourite influencers. However, Rachel finds it troublesome to share her favourite items with her friends as she has to message them about them. Rachel wishes the TikTok shop function could be more social and allow for more interaction between her friends and her favourite influencers. Rachel also wishes there was a centralised space for her to view all the items endorsed by her favourite influencers.

## What it does

Our solution is to create a personalised TikTok shop profile embedded into the current TikTok profile for users based on a short quiz. The quiz will ask users for their style preferences, favourite users from the list they are following, their sizing, favourite brands. After the quiz, users can find people with similar interests through hashtags and follow their favourites/wishlist page for more inspiration. The user’s profile page will also have an additional “Shopping Pins” tab where they can create folders to collate their favourite products. These folders can be shared with their friends who can also add products. Followers can easily buy whichever products they like through the “Shopping Pins” tab.

## How we built it

Our feature is built using Ionic Framework and Angular for the front-end user interface. We simulated a user’s TikTok profile page on an Android phone, and incorporated our “Shopping Pins” feature as an additional profile tab. The shop profile quiz is included as a separate button on the profile page called “Create Shop Profile”, and we intended to store the user’s quiz answers into a database such as Firebase in our future implementations.

## Challenges we ran into

Our idea was to use a quiz to generate a personalised Tiktok Shop profile for users. However, we faced challenges in creating this profile under the short timeframe we had. Given more time, we would have leveraged on Machine Learning technology and generate a unique, personalised Tiktok Shop profile for users based on their quiz answers, helping them to find others who share the same interests as them.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of our implementation of our “Shopping Pins” idea, as we managed to bring our idea from the drawing board and integrate it into a sample TikTok user’s profile.

## What we learned

As most of our team members were new to Ionic Framework, we started almost from scratch and were able to learn a lot about using this framework to code a mobile application despite the short time period.

## What's next for Tikshop Connect

As the quiz gathers data on what the user likes, Tiktok can use this data to carry out personalised marketing and recommend new items to users. Users can also view their collaboration pin boards and group buy their friends’ wishlist items together.
